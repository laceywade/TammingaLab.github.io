Welcome to the website for the Language Variation and Cognition Lab! We are located in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). The lab is directed by [Meredith Tamminga](http://meredithtamminga.com/). We work closely with [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/) and [his lab](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/).

We are affiliated with [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/), Penn's hub for the integrative study of the mind, as well as several of its supported research groups: 
* The [Integrated Language Sciences and Technology Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/)
* The [Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-sbsi/)
* The [Social and Cultural Evolution Working Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/scew/)

Our research is situated at the intersection of sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. Lab members work on a broad range of  topics that are tied together by our shared aims of:
* Modeling the mental representation and processing of inter- and intra-speaker linguistic variability
* Using psycholinguistic evidence as a window on the relationship between social and grammatical influences on variable behavior
* Integrating experimental and naturalistic linguistic data across diverse populations
* Relating individual and group-level linguistic behavior and phenomena, especially with respect to language change
* Developing quantitative approaches to the microtemporal dynamics of language variation in perception and production

For selected papers and presentations, see the [Research](https://tammingalab.github.io/research/) page.

Inquiries from both prospective undergraduate RAs and prospective Ph.D. students should be directed to Meredith Tamminga.
